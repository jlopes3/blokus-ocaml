Final Project: Blokus by Jonathon Lopes

This project is going to be an implementation of the board game Blokus. Blokus is a turn-based
strategy board game that involves players putting pieces onto a board. Here is a link to a good
description of the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus#:~:text=Blokus%20(%2F%CB%88bl%C9%92,and%20the%20pieces%20are%20polyominoes.
